# Claude Command Playbooks

These files are the StudioFlow "skills" equivalent for Claude Code.

Use them as repeatable runbooks when operating the loop.

## Available Playbooks

- `studioflow-code-to-canvas.md`
  - Use when code is the starting point.
- `studioflow-design-to-code.md`
  - Use when Figma is the starting point.
- `studioflow-loop-verify.md`
  - Use when you need full gate validation.

## Usage Pattern

1. Open Claude in `studioflow-project`.
2. Load the relevant playbook.
3. Follow the runbook commands exactly.
4. Stop on failed gates and fix minimal scope.

These playbooks are intentionally concise, operational, and strict.
